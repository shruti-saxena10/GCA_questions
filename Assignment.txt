What are some common challenges you might face while setting up a CI/CD pipeline and how do you address them?
Challenge: Integrating different tools for version control, build, test, and deployment can be complex.
Solution: Choose a CI/CD tool that supports integration with a wide range of tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps). Leverage plugins and extensions for seamless integration.

Challenge: Managing dependencies and ensuring they are resolved correctly across builds.
Solution: Use dependency management tools (e.g., pip for Python, npm for JavaScript). Implement lock files (e.g., requirements.txt, package-lock.json) to maintain version consistency.
